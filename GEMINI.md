# Directory Overview

This directory (`C:\Users\kgy20`) appears to be the primary user home directory. It serves as a central location for personal files, application data, and system configurations, rather than being a dedicated software project.

The directory contains a mix of personal documents, downloads, desktop items, and configuration files for various applications.

# Key Directories

*   **`Desktop`**: Contains files and shortcuts visible on the user's desktop.
*   **`Documents`**: A common location for storing personal documents, such as text files, spreadsheets, and reports.
*   **`Downloads`**: The default location for files downloaded from the internet.
*   **`Pictures`**, **`Music`**, **`Videos`**: Standard directories for storing personal media files.
*   **`.gemini`**: This directory stores configuration, history, and temporary files specifically for the Gemini CLI agent.
*   **`gemini_proj`**: A directory that appears to be intended for Gemini-related projects.

# Usage

This directory is for general-purpose, user-specific storage. For software development or other focused projects, it is recommended to work within a dedicated project subdirectory (like `gemini_proj`) to keep project-related files organized and isolated from personal user files.
